Scaffold for Javascript Apps
==============================

## NPM ##
* nodejs/npm should be installed on your system

Once installed, you can install this app's dependencies locally with

    npm install

This will install everything listed in packages.json at the versions listed. 

## Bower ##

Bower appears to be useful for front-end dependencies. IE Getting angular etc. This differs from npm which is focussed on code that runs in node.

## Jasmine ##
(unit testing)

node_modules/jasmine-node/bin/jasmine-node introduction-1.3.1.js 

## Uglify ##
(building minified js)
